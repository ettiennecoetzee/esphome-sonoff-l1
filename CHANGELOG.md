# Changelog

## v1.0.0
- Initial public release of the ESPHome external component `sonoff_l1`.
- Adds a `light:` platform for Sonoff L1 controllers (ESP8285/ESP8266 family).
- Provides lambda-friendly effect helpers (gradient, breath, RGB patterns, sync-to-music).
- Fix: selecting “Effects: None” returns the controller to static mode while keeping current color and brightness.
- Includes two examples:
  - GitHub install example (pinned to `v1.0.0`)
  - Local install example
- README includes Home Assistant oriented flashing and setup guidance.
